# Mobile-First Cooking & Shopping UX Research

## Core Research Questions

1. **Cooking Experience**: What UX patterns make cooking from a recipe on mobile genuinely useful vs. frustrating?
2. **Shopping Integration**: How do the best apps bridge the gap between meal planning, recipe discovery, and grocery shopping?
3. **Context Awareness**: How should the UI adapt to different cooking contexts (prep, active cooking, waiting)?
4. **Gesture & Interaction**: What mobile-specific interactions (swipe, voice, hands-free) actually work in a kitchen environment?
5. **Information Architecture**: How should recipes be structured for mobile consumption vs. desktop browsing?
6. **Progressive Disclosure**: When should complexity be hidden vs. revealed in cooking apps?
7. **Offline & Constraints**: How do top apps handle poor connectivity, messy hands, and kitchen distractions?
8. **Shopping List UX**: What makes a shopping list genuinely useful vs. just a list of ingredients?

## Success Criteria

- Identify 15+ specific UX patterns with evidence of effectiveness
- Document 10+ anti-patterns (what NOT to do) with failure evidence
- Map the complete user journey from meal planning → shopping → cooking
- Uncover non-obvious insights from cross-domain research
- Generate actionable recommendations for "Babe, What's for Dinner?" app

## Evidence Standards

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Primary** | Direct user research, A/B test results, analytics data | Usability study findings |
| **Secondary** | Expert analysis, design system documentation, case studies | Nielsen Norman Group reports |
| **Tertiary** | Industry articles, app store reviews, designer opinions | Medium articles, reviews |
| **Speculative** | Patents, concept designs, academic research | Future interaction paradigms |

## Key Stakeholders & Perspectives

1. **Home Cooks** - Varying skill levels, time constraints, dietary needs
2. **Grocery Shoppers** - Store navigation, budget consciousness, list management
3. **Meal Planners** - Weekly planning, household coordination, variety seeking
4. **Kitchen Novices** - Need guidance, confidence building, error recovery
5. **Busy Parents** - Interruption tolerance, quick decisions, kid-friendly options
6. **Health-Conscious Users** - Nutritional info, substitutions, tracking
7. **Budget Shoppers** - Price comparison, pantry management, waste reduction

## Potential Biases to Guard Against

- **Designer Bias**: Assuming users want "beautiful" over "functional"
- **Feature Creep Bias**: Adding complexity that research doesn't support
- **Recency Bias**: Overvaluing recent apps while ignoring proven patterns
- **Survivorship Bias**: Only studying successful apps, missing failure lessons
- **Tech Enthusiasm Bias**: Assuming users want voice/AI when simpler solutions work
- **Desktop-to-Mobile Bias**: Shrinking desktop patterns instead of rethinking for mobile
- **Power User Bias**: Designing for enthusiasts, alienating casual users

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Mobile app UX (iOS/Android, PWA)
- Cooking/recipe presentation
- Shopping list generation and use
- Meal planning workflows
- Kitchen context interactions
- Grocery store integration patterns

### Out of Scope
- Smart kitchen device integration (IoT)
- Restaurant/takeout ordering
- Social features (sharing, community)
- Monetization strategies (separate research)
- Backend architecture decisions

## Temporal Range

- **Historical** (2010-2018): Early recipe apps, desktop-first conversions
- **Recent** (2019-2023): Mobile-native designs, COVID cooking boom
- **Current** (2024-2025): AI integration, voice assistants, gesture innovation
- **Future** (2026+): Emerging patents, speculative designs, AR/VR concepts

## Expected Output

A strategic report containing:
1. Evidence-based UX pattern catalog
2. Anti-pattern documentation with failure analysis
3. User journey mapping with pain points
4. Cross-domain insights (what cooking apps can learn from other domains)
5. Specific recommendations for implementation priority
6. Research gaps requiring user testing
