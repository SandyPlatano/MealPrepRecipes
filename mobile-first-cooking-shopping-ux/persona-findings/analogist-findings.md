## Cross-Domain Pattern Catalog

### From Fitness Apps

| Pattern | Source | Cooking Application | Evidence |
|---------|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **Streaks** | Duolingo, Strava | "Cooking streaks" for consecutive days/weeks | "Streaks & badges rewarding users for consistency" increase engagement 30% |
| **Progress Rings** | Apple Fitness | Daily cooking goals visualization | Apple's rings "inspire users to achieve daily activity goals" |
| **Workout Mode** | Nike Training | Cook Mode with large text, screen awake | "Font size, big buttons, and voice commands incredibly helpful" |
| **Rest Day Suggestions** | Fitness apps | "Easy meal" days after complex cooking | Prevents burnout, acknowledges recovery |
| **Personal Records** | Strava | Fastest prep time, most complex dish mastered | Gamification drives repeat engagement |

**Strongest Transfer:** Nike Training Club's workout flow—showing one exercise at a time with large visuals, timer, and "next up" preview—directly maps to recipe step presentation.

### From Language Learning (Duolingo)

| Pattern | Application | Implementation Idea |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Daily Goals** | Skill building | "Cook 3 new recipes this week" challenges |
| **Skill Trees** | Technique progression | Knife skills → Sauces → Timing → Full menus |
| **Spaced Repetition** | Recipe memory | Resurface recipes at optimal intervals to build repertoire |
| **Streak Anxiety** | Engagement hook | Widget showing cooking streak with personality |
| **League Competition** | Social motivation | Weekly household/friend challenges |

**Duolingo's Hook Model Applied to Cooking:**
1. **Trigger**: Push notification "What's for dinner tonight?"
2. **Action**: Open app, pick recipe (low friction)
3. **Variable Reward**: XP, streak maintenance, skill unlocks
4. **Investment**: Saved recipes, logged meals, streak history

> "Fito is a gamified fitness tracker described as 'Like Duolingo but for fitness.' The app's widget moods shift based on when you last worked out, getting progressively funnier."

This exact pattern works for cooking—widget showing a hungry cartoon character that gets sadder/funnier based on cooking activity.

### From Music Apps (Spotify)

| Pattern | Application | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Personalized Playlists** | Weekly meal plans | "Discover Weekly Meals" based on taste profile |
| **Mood-based Discovery** | Context-aware suggestions | "Quick & Easy" when rushed, "Weekend Projects" for leisure |
| **Collaborative Playlists** | Shared meal planning | Household members add to weekly plan |
| **Listening History** | Cooking history | "Recently Made" for quick repeat access |
| **Release Radar** | New recipes | Personalized new recipe suggestions weekly |

### From Gaming

| Pattern | Source | Cooking Application |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **Tutorial Levels** | All games | Progressive onboarding: toast → eggs → full breakfast |
| **Achievement Badges** | Xbox/PlayStation | "Made your first soup", "Mastered knife cuts" |
| **Difficulty Settings** | Games | Recipe complexity selector (Easy/Medium/Hard) |
| **Save Points** | RPGs | Recipe checkpoints for multi-day preparations |
| **Crafting Systems** | Minecraft | Combine base recipes into advanced dishes |
| **Quest Logs** | RPGs | Weekly cooking quests with variety goals |

> "Gamification influences habit formation by making the rewards for exercising immediate and tangible. This contrasts with traditional fitness regimens where benefits can take weeks to manifest."

**Applied to Cooking:** Traditional cooking benefits (health, savings) are delayed. Gamification provides immediate satisfaction.

### From Aviation/Checklists

| Pattern | Source | Application |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-flight Checklists** | Pilots | Mise en place verification before cooking |
| **Challenge-Response** | Cockpit procedures | Voice confirmation of completed steps |
| **Abnormal Procedures** | Emergency checklists | Substitution guides, recovery from mistakes |
| **Crew Resource Management** | Aviation safety | Multi-cook coordination features |

> "Aviation checklist design cognitive load" research shows step completion verification reduces errors significantly.

### From E-commerce (Amazon, Instacart)

| Pattern | Source | Application |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **"Buy Again"** | Amazon | "Cook Again" with one-tap meal repeats |
| **"Frequently Bought Together"** | Amazon | Ingredient bundles for specific recipes |
| **Carousel Browsing** | Mobile shopping | Recipe discovery with horizontal scrolling |
| **Cart Upsells** | Checkout flows | Recipe suggestions based on shopping list |
| **Delivery Windows** | Instacart | Meal timing coordination |

> "Users on grocery apps like Amazon Whole Foods quickly began shopping on the homepage by adding 'Past Purchases' to reorder to their cart."

## Cautionary Analogies (Transfers That May Fail)

| Analogy | Why It Seems Good | Why It Might Fail |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Social Media Feed** | Endless recipe discovery | Recipe fatigue, decision paralysis |
| **Dating App Swiping** | Quick recipe selection | Superficial judgment, low commitment |
| **LinkedIn Endorsements** | Recipe ratings | Gaming, unreliable signal |
| **Uber Rating** | Chef/recipe ratings | Limited sample sizes, recency bias |
| **Twitter Threads** | Step-by-step storytelling | Fragmentation, context loss |

## Biological/Natural Analogies

### Ant Colony Optimization
How it works: Ants leave pheromone trails; frequently used paths get stronger signals.
**Cooking Application:** Most-used recipes in household become more prominent; less-used fade. Natural curation without algorithmic manipulation.

### Circadian Rhythms
How it works: Bodies follow natural cycles for eating, sleeping, activity.
**Cooking Application:** Meal suggestions timed to user's actual eating patterns, not arbitrary meal categories.

### Predator-Prey Balance
How it works: Ecosystems self-regulate through feedback loops.
**Cooking Application:** If user cooks too complex, suggest simpler meals. If all simple, nudge toward growth. Balance variety automatically.
