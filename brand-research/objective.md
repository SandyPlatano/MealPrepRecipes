# Brand Identity Research Objectives

## Project: "Babe, What's for Dinner?"

### Core Research Questions

1. **Color Psychology**: Is coral/orange (#F97316) the optimal primary color for a meal prep app? What tertiary colors complete the palette?

2. **Typography**: Is the Caveat + JetBrains Mono pairing distinctive and legible enough? What alternatives exist?

3. **Logo Design**: Should we use Lucide's ChefHat or create a custom icon? What makes a logo recognizable at 16px?

4. **Brand Archetype**: Is this brand a Jester, Caregiver, or hybrid? Does "Babe" resonate or alienate?

5. **Competitive Positioning**: What visual elements are overused in meal planning apps? Where's the white space?

6. **UI Personality**: How much personality should UI components have vs neutral functionality?

7. **Motion Design**: What's the appropriate animation budget for a cooking/food app?

8. **Marketing Presence**: What hero images and social templates best represent the product?
