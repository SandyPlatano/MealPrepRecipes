# Typography Research: "Babe, What's for Dinner?" Meal Prep App

**Research Date:** December 18, 2025
**Current Typography Stack:**
- Handwritten: Caveat (for "Babe," accent text)
- Monospace: JetBrains Mono (headings, "What's for Dinner?")
- Body: Inter

---

## Executive Summary

The current typography combination (Caveat + JetBrains Mono + Inter) creates an unusual but potentially distinctive brand identity that blends playful handwritten warmth with technical precision. However, research reveals several considerations:

**Key Findings:**
1. **Caveat** performs well for legibility among handwritten fonts and has variable font support (weight axis)
2. **JetBrains Mono** is uncommon in food apps but could differentiate the brand if the "tech meets cooking" aesthetic is intentional
3. **Inter** is an excellent modern choice with variable font support, widely used and highly optimized
4. The handwritten + monospace pairing is unconventional but creates memorable contrast
5. Kitchen legibility requires **minimum 20px body text**, preferably **30pt+ for viewing distance**, with large touch targets

**Overall Confidence Rating: 7.5/10** - The current stack has potential but needs strategic refinement.

---

## 1. Handwritten Font Analysis

### Current: Caveat

**Strengths:**
- Designed specifically for both short annotations and body text usage
- Better legibility than most handwritten fonts despite casual style
- Well-defined characters remain clear even at smaller sizes
- **Variable font available** with weight axis (wght 400-700)
- Pairs well with Inter, Avenir, Gilroy, SF Pro
- Authentic handwritten feel with smooth, rounded strokes
- Described as "loose and expressive" with "whimsical personality"

**Weaknesses:**
- Moderate x-height may impact legibility at small sizes or distance
- Casual varying stroke widths affect character differentiation in longer passages
- Handwritten style can affect spacing consistency
- Best suited for display purposes, not extensive body text

**Confidence Rating: 8/10** - Excellent choice for accent text like "Babe,"

### Alternative Handwritten Fonts Comparison

| Font | Style | Legibility | Best Use Case | Confidence |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Satisfy** | Elegant cursive, modern fluidity | Good | Beauty/lifestyle brands, elegant touch | 7/10 |
| **Pacifico** | Retro beach culture, bold curves | Moderate | Casual, vintage surf vibe | 6/10 |
| **Cookie** | Brush calligraphy, retro | Moderate | Friendly informal with vintage charm | 6/10 |
| **Kalam** | Casual handwriting, structured | Good | Approachable, readable | 7/10 |
| **Dancing Script** | Flowing cursive, elegant | Moderate | Romantic, sophisticated | 6/10 |

**Recommendation:** **Keep Caveat** - It outperforms alternatives in legibility and has variable font support for performance optimization. Its pairing with Inter is already validated by design resources.

---

## 2. Monospace Font Analysis

### Current: JetBrains Mono

**Strengths:**
- Released 2020, modern and distinctive
- Simplified mono with variable weight axis
- Tall x-height for better legibility
- "Soft and comfortable" with beautiful code ligatures
- Creates unique "tech meets cooking" aesthetic
- Well-suited for modern, digital-forward brands

**Weaknesses:**
- **Highly unconventional for food apps** - no case studies found
- Associated strongly with developer tools and coding
- May feel cold/mechanical for food context
- Monospace can be space-inefficient for headings
- Could confuse brand message if tech angle isn't intentional

**Confidence Rating: 5/10** - Technically excellent but questionable for food context

### Food App Typography Patterns

Research shows food apps typically use:
- **Modern sans-serifs** with clean lines (DM Sans, Space Grotesk, Outfit)
- **Geometric fonts** with approachable rounded forms (Poppins, Nunito, Fredoka)
- **Classic serif + sans combinations** for warmth + structure
- **Script fonts for display** paired with clean sans for body

**Key Insight:** "Linear, straight fonts would look interesting next to haute cuisine" and "fonts with a techie appearance are well suited for modern cafes to attract Gen-X audiences."

### Alternative Monospace/Modern Fonts

| Font | Style | Food App Fit | Characteristics | Confidence |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Space Grotesk** | Proportional sans (from Space Mono) | Good | Modern, geometric, tech feel but more readable | 8/10 |
| **DM Sans** | Low-contrast geometric | Excellent | Clean, modern, optimized for small text | 9/10 |
| **Outfit** | Geometric sans-serif | Excellent | Friendly, approachable, variable font | 8.5/10 |
| **Work Sans** | Contemporary sans | Good | Clean, professional, pairs with scripts | 7.5/10 |
| **Poppins** | Geometric, friendly | Excellent | Warm, approachable, modern | 8/10 |

**Recommendation:** Consider **Space Grotesk** as a compromise - it maintains the monospace aesthetic (derived from Space Mono) but is proportional and more suitable for non-coding contexts. It pairs beautifully with Inter and creates a "sleek, innovative look perfect for tech websites."

If pivoting away from monospace entirely: **Outfit** or **DM Sans** would provide modern, clean aesthetics while being friendlier for food context.

**Strengths:**
- **Variable font available** with weight axis (100-900)
- Built for the web with optical sizing that auto-adjusts
- Excellent readability across devices
- Widely validated in modern interfaces
- Pairs well with Caveat (validated pairing)
- Neutral, versatile, professional
- Google Fonts compatible with automatic variable/static fallback

**Weaknesses:**
- Very common (may lack distinctiveness)
- Somewhat technical/corporate feel

**Confidence Rating: 9.5/10** - Industry-leading body font choice

**Recommendation:** **Keep Inter** - It's perfectly suited for the role, has variable font support for performance, and established pairing validation with Caveat.

---

## 4. Font Pairing Best Practices

### Handwritten + Monospace Pairing Analysis

**Unconventional but Validated:**
- "Manic [handwritten] is perfectly complemented by the monospace font IBM Plex Mono"
- Cooper BT (rounded serif) + Roboto Mono creates successful "retro font pairing from two different eras"
- **Key principle:** Extreme contrast creates memorable, distinctive pairings

**Success Factors:**
1. **Clear hierarchy** - handwritten for accent/display, mono for structure
2. **Sufficient size difference** - prevent competition
3. **Contrasting weights** - bold handwritten vs. regular mono
4. **Limited handwritten usage** - only for "Babe," and accent elements
5. **Monospace for structure** - headings, labels, systematic elements

**Playful + Professional Balance:**
- "The star is your gorgeous handwritten font. The sidekick is the plain font you pair it with. Don't make your star compete for attention."
- "Creating juxtaposition in your fonts creates visual interest and allows fonts not to compete"
- "Sans fonts with casual letter design are often best choice to pair with script fonts"

### Recommended Pairings for Food Apps

**Warm & Approachable:**
- Handwritten/Script + Clean Sans-Serif
- Rounded geometric (Fredoka, Nunito) + Structured sans (Montserrat, Work Sans)
- "Pacifico + Quicksand adds dimension and character, evoking adventure and laid-back fun for food/travel brands"

**Professional Yet Friendly:**
- "Poppins + Work Sans creates clean, modern look with subtle variation - approachable yet professional"
- "Raleway + Lobster ideal for speakeasy bars, artisanal bakeries - mix of professionalism and approachability"

**Confidence Rating: 7/10** - Current pairing is distinctive but polarizing

## 5. Kitchen/Recipe Legibility Research

### Critical Requirements for Cooking Mode

**Font Size:**
- **Minimum: 20px body text** for standard viewing
- **Recommended: 30pt+ for distance viewing**
- "When reading recipes in the kitchen, it's best to err on side of too large instead of too small"
- Mobile: 16-18px minimum, but kitchen context demands larger

**Viewing Distance:**
- **4-6 feet for 10" screen equivalents**
- Kitchen users are standing, moving, hands busy
- Glancing from distance while cooking
- May have messy hands preventing zoom

**Typography Best Practices:**
- "Clear and solid typography based on san-serif fonts makes information scannable and legible on screens of different sizes"
- **Line height: 1.5x (150%)** for optimal readability
- **Line length: 30-40 characters on mobile**, 45-75 on desktop
- **Left-aligned text** with consistent left margin
- **Avoid all caps** - reduces readability by uniform rectangular shape
- **Ample spacing between paragraphs** - 0.8 to 2 extra lines

**Accessibility Standards:**
- **WCAG 2.0: Minimum 18pt regular or 14pt bold**
- **Color contrast: 4.5:1 minimum** for body content
- **Adjustable font sizes** for users with low vision
- **Screen reader compatible** ingredient/instruction markup
- **Avoid light font weights** - Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold only

### Mobile Kitchen Context

**80-90% of recipe app users access via mobile devices**
- "Over 75% of consumers look up recipes on phones while grocery shopping"
- "Nearly 60% of adults 25-34 use mobile devices as cooking companions"
- **Thumb-friendly buttons** - large tap targets, proper spacing
- **Voice commands increasingly essential** for hands-free operation

**Case Study Insights:**
- "Font size, big buttons, and voice commands incredibly helpful when hands are dirty"
- "Mobile chosen because easier to use while cooking compared to big & bulky devices"
- "Steps listed in large font, easy to follow along" (In the Kitchen app)

**Confidence Rating: 9/10** - Strong research consensus on requirements

## 6. Type Scale System Recommendations

### Modular Scale Principles

**Base Font Size:**
- Desktop: **16-18px** (1.6-1.8rem) body text
- Mobile: **14-16px** body text (scale down for smaller viewports)

**Recommended Scale Ratios:**

| Ratio | Value | Best For | Food App Fit |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Perfect Fourth** | 1.333 | Distinct visual hierarchy, varied content | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **Major Third** | 1.250 | Moderate, clear increments for UI | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **Minor Third** | 1.200 | Subtle, dense text layouts | Good for dashboard |
| **Golden Ratio** | 1.618 | High-end creative, visually pleasing | Too dramatic |
| **Major Second** | 1.125 | Subtle increments, tight hierarchy | Too subtle |

**Guidance:**
- "Choose small scales for polished business products; medium scales for engaging consumer products; large scales for bold visual statement"
- **Recommendation: Major Third (1.250)** - Creates clear hierarchy without excessive drama, suits food/cooking content

### Proposed Type Scale (Major Third - 1.250)

Using 16px base:

```css
:root {
  /* Mobile/Desktop fluid sizing using clamp() */
  --fs-100: clamp(0.64rem, calc(0.64rem + 0vw), 0.64rem);   /* 10.24px - small text */
  --fs-200: clamp(0.80rem, calc(0.77rem + 0.15vw), 0.89rem); /* 12.8-14.24px - meta */
  --fs-300: clamp(1.00rem, calc(0.96rem + 0.19vw), 1.11rem); /* 16-17.76px - body */
  --fs-400: clamp(1.25rem, calc(1.20rem + 0.24vw), 1.39rem); /* 20-22.24px - h4 */
  --fs-500: clamp(1.56rem, calc(1.50rem + 0.30vw), 1.74rem); /* 24.96-27.84px - h3 */
  --fs-600: clamp(1.95rem, calc(1.88rem + 0.37vw), 2.17rem); /* 31.2-34.72px - h2 */
  --fs-700: clamp(2.44rem, calc(2.35rem + 0.47vw), 2.71rem); /* 39-43.36px - h1 */
  --fs-800: clamp(3.05rem, calc(2.93rem + 0.58vw), 3.39rem); /* 48.8-54.24px - hero */
}
```

**Kitchen Cooking Mode Scale** (larger for distance viewing):

```css
.cooking-mode {
  --fs-step: clamp(1.50rem, calc(1.44rem + 0.30vw), 1.67rem); /* 24-26.72px - instructions */
  --fs-ingredient: clamp(1.25rem, calc(1.20rem + 0.24vw), 1.39rem); /* 20-22.24px - ingredients */
  --fs-timer: clamp(2.44rem, calc(2.35rem + 0.47vw), 2.71rem); /* 39-43.36px - timers */
}
```

### Responsive Typography Strategy

**Fluid Typography (Recommended):**
- Use `clamp()` instead of static breakpoints
- Smoothly scales between viewport sizes
- Define min/max bounds for control
- "Modern websites rely on fluid typography, variable fonts, responsive type scales that adapt across devices"

**Line Height:**
- Body text: **1.5-1.6** (150-160%)
- Headings: **1.1-1.3** (110-130%)
- Tight spaces (labels): **1.2** (120%)

**Line Length:**
- Desktop: **45-75 characters** optimal
- Mobile: **30-40 characters** optimal
- Cooking instructions: **Shorter preferred** for scanning

**Tools:**
- modularscale.com - Scale calculator
- typescale.com - Visual scale preview
- TypeScales Figma Plugin - Design integration

**Confidence Rating: 9/10** - Industry-standard approach

## 7. Variable Font Opportunities

### Performance Benefits

**Why Variable Fonts:**
- **Single file** contains multiple weights/styles instead of 4-8 separate files
- "Loading 2-3+ font styles? Better to use Variable Font to reduce payload and increase performance"
- Example: 4 weights + italics = 8 files (~500KB) vs. 1 variable file (~similar or smaller)
- Reduces HTTP requests
- Infinite weight/width adjustments without additional file loads

**Current Stack Variable Font Status:**

| Font | Variable Version | Axis Available | Status |
|------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| **Caveat** | ✅ Yes | wght (400-700) | Available on Google Fonts |
| **Inter** | ✅ Yes | wght (100-900) | Full variable support, optical sizing |
| **JetBrains Mono** | ✅ Yes | wght axis | Variable version available |

**Implementation Strategy:**

```css
/* Inter Variable */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 100 900; /* Variable weight range */
  font-display: swap;
  src: url('Inter-Variable.woff2') format('woff2-variations');
}

/* Caveat Variable */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Caveat';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400 700; /* Variable weight range */
  font-display: swap;
  src: url('Caveat-Variable.woff2') format('woff2-variations');
}
```

**Google Fonts Automatic Fallback:**
- "Compatible devices/browsers use InterVariable font while non-compatible devices use normal Inter font"
- Graceful degradation ensures universal support

### Animation Possibilities

Variable fonts enable smooth weight/width transitions:
- Hover effects on buttons (weight shift)
- Loading states (width oscillation)
- Attention-drawing micro-interactions
- "Fluid animations without JavaScript performance issues if optimized"

**Caution:** "JavaScript-driven animations should be optimized to avoid slowing user experience"

**Confidence Rating: 9.5/10** - Strong recommendation for variable fonts

---

## 8. Final Typography Recommendations

### Option A: Refined Current Stack (Recommended)

**Rationale:** Maintains distinctive identity while optimizing performance
