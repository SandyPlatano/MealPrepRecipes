### Highest Confidence Recommendations (95%+)
1. Use 1200 x 630 pixels for OG images with 50px margins
2. Instagram feed posts: 1080 x 1350 pixels (portrait)
3. App store screenshots: First 3 must show Value → Usage → Trust
4. Press kit must include logo package (color, B&W, multiple formats)
5. Email templates: Mobile-optimized with clear CTAs

### Highest Impact / Lowest Effort
1. **OG Image Optimization:** Verify current 1200x630 image follows best practices
2. **Social Templates:** Use Canva to create 5-10 Instagram templates immediately
3. **Screenshot Audit:** Review first 3 app store screenshots for conversion framework
4. **Press Kit Foundation:** Compile existing assets into organized structure

### Avoid These Mistakes
1. Launching merchandise before 10k+ users (premature)
2. More than 40% text on OG images (cluttered, poor mobile experience)
3. Ignoring first 3 app store screenshots (highest conversion impact)
4. Email designs not mobile-optimized (60%+ users on mobile)
5. Outdated press kit assets (damages brand trust)

### Questions for Further Exploration
1. Current app store conversion rate? (Benchmark for screenshot optimization)
2. Email list size? (Determines template development priority)
3. Any press inquiries received? (Validates press kit urgency)
4. Current social media following? (Informs content template needs)
5. Budget for paid social ads? (May require additional ad-specific templates)
