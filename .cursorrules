# Cursor Rules

## Context7 MCP Integration

Always use Context7 MCP tools when the user needs:
- Code generation
- Setup or configuration steps
- Library/API documentation

This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools (`resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs`) without the user having to explicitly ask. When encountering requests for:
- Code examples or implementations
- Setting up libraries or frameworks
- Understanding how to use specific APIs or libraries
- Configuration file examples

Automatically resolve the library ID and fetch the relevant documentation using Context7 before proceeding with the response.
