## Appendix: Methodology

**Research Approach**: Systems-level investigation focused on stakeholder relationships, integration networks, competitive dynamics, and causal chains

**Search Queries Executed**: 8 web searches covering ecosystem integrations, API partnerships, smart kitchen IoT, B2B wellness, retail collaborations, supply chain dynamics, and market synergies

**Analysis Framework**:
1. Stakeholder mapping (value chain participants)
2. Integration landscape (API platforms, IoT, voice assistants)
3. Network effects typology (direct, indirect, cross-side)
4. Switching cost mechanisms (data lock-in, personalization, workflow integration)
5. Causal chain modeling (reinforcing loops, balancing feedback, breakage points)
6. Second-order effects (AI commoditization, privacy backlash, B2B2C expansion)

**Confidence Calibration**: Ratings based on data availability, source quality, and predictability of trends

**Limitations**:
- Limited public data on B2B wellness contracts
- Proprietary metrics (retention, CAC, LTV) not disclosed
- Rapidly evolving AI capabilities create forecast uncertainty
- Regulatory landscape (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA) still developing
