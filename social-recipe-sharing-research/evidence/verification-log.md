## Cross-Source Triangulation

### High Agreement Findings
1. **Community-driven platforms succeed**: Cookpad, Ravelry, AllRecipes all validate
2. **Moderation is essential**: Multiple sources (Salon, Food52, NYT Cooking)
3. **AI is disrupting recipe content**: Yummly shutdown, multiple predictions
4. **Accessibility is poor**: Academic research confirms

### Contradictory Sources
| Topic | Source 1 | Source 2 | Resolution |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| Recipe app market growth | Growing (multiple) | Yummly shutdown | Growing overall, incumbents struggling |
| Community value | Cookpad success | Pestle success | Both models valid for different users |
| AI readiness | Futurist papers | Quality concerns | AI ready for assistance, not replacement |

## Confidence Rating Summary

| Finding | Sources | Triangulation | Confidence |
|---------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Cookpad community model works | 5+ sources | Strong | HIGH |
| Moderation is non-negotiable | 4+ sources | Strong | HIGH |
| Yummly died from corporate neglect | 3 sources | Moderate | HIGH |
| Household features underserved | 3-4 sources | Moderate | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| AI will augment recipes | 3+ sources | Weak | MEDIUM |

| Historical data | N/A | Historical by nature |

## Key Source Limitations

2. **Western bias**: Most sources US/UK focused
3. **Survivorship bias**: Failed platforms harder to research
4. **Recency**: Some older articles, industry moves fast
5. **AI predictions**: High uncertainty inherent
