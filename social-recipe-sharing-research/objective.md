# Research Objective: Social Recipe Sharing & Community Building

## Context
This research supports the development of **Babe, What's for Dinner? / Meal Prep OS** - a meal planning application. The goal is to understand how social and community features can enhance user engagement, retention, and potential monetization.

## Core Research Questions

### Primary Questions
1. **What makes recipe sharing "social" vs. just "sharing"?** What transforms passive recipe databases into active communities?
2. **What community features drive the highest engagement and retention** in food/recipe apps?
3. **How do successful platforms balance private (household) and public (community) sharing?**
4. **What are the proven monetization models** for social recipe platforms?
5. **What are the failure modes** - why do recipe communities fail or become toxic?

### Secondary Questions
- How do AI and personalization intersect with community features?
- What role does visual content (photos, videos) play vs. structured recipe data?
- How do recipe communities handle dietary restrictions and preferences at scale?
- What's the relationship between recipe quality and community engagement?
- How do household/family sharing needs differ from broader community sharing?

## Success Criteria
- Identify 3-5 distinct community models with evidence of success/failure
- Document at least 10 specific features with engagement data
- Map the competitive landscape with differentiation opportunities
- Uncover non-obvious insights from cross-domain analysis
- Provide actionable recommendations for Meal Prep OS

## Evidence Standards
- **Primary sources**: Platform documentation, user research, app store data
- **Secondary sources**: Industry reports, expert analysis, case studies
- **Tertiary sources**: News coverage, blog posts, user reviews
- Preference for data from 2020-2025 (post-pandemic cooking behavior shift)

## Key Stakeholders & Perspectives
- **Home cooks**: Casual users seeking inspiration and convenience
- **Meal preppers**: Efficiency-focused batch cooking audience
- **Households/Families**: Coordination and dietary management needs
- **Food enthusiasts**: Recipe creators, food photographers
- **Health-conscious users**: Diet trackers, nutrition-focused
- **Platform operators**: Moderation, monetization, growth

## Potential Biases to Guard Against
- **Survivorship bias**: Only studying successful platforms, ignoring failures
- **Tech-centrism**: Assuming digital is always better than analog solutions
- **Feature creep bias**: Believing more features = better community
- **Western/US-centrism**: Missing international recipe sharing patterns
- **Recency bias**: Overweighting current trends vs. timeless patterns

## Scope Boundaries
**In Scope**:
- Recipe sharing platforms and features
- Food-focused social networks
- Household/family coordination features
- Community moderation and quality
- Monetization strategies
- Cross-domain analogies from other communities

**Out of Scope**:
- Restaurant/food delivery platforms (unless community features relevant)
- Professional chef/culinary school platforms
- Pure e-commerce food sites
- Social media platforms without food focus

## Expected Output
A strategic report that enables informed decisions about:
1. Whether to build community features (and which ones)
2. How to sequence feature development
3. What community model fits Meal Prep OS best
4. Potential risks and mitigation strategies
