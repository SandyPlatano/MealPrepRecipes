# Archive: Legacy Design Plans

This directory contains design plans that were explored but ultimately rejected in favor of the current **Warm & Cozy** design system.

## Files

### `2025-12-29-retro-brand-kit-design.md`
- **Status:** Rejected
- **Date:** December 29, 2025
- **Reason:** Neo-brutalist/retro design with hard shadows and 2px borders was deemed too harsh for a family meal planning app
- **Replaced by:** Warm & Cozy design system (soft shadows, subtle borders, lime accent)

## Current Design System

See `/Users/ferm/Documents/GitHub/MealPrepRecipes/nextjs/src/lib/brand/design-system.md` for the active design system documentation.
