## Version 1.5 - Retro/Neo-Brutalist (Rejected)
**Exploration Date:** December 29, 2025
**Status:** Rejected, Archived

### Overview
A bold neo-brutalist design exploration with hard shadows and thick borders.

### Key Characteristics
- **Color Palette:** Warm beige background (`#FFFBEB`), golden yellow accent (`#FFD166`)
- **Typography:** Space Mono (headings), Work Sans (body)
- **Borders:** Heavy 2px black borders on all interactive elements
- **Shadows:** Hard drop shadows (`shadow-retro: 4px 4px 0px 0px #000`)
- **Philosophy:** Bold, playful, retro-inspired

### Rejection Reason
Too harsh and aggressive for a family-oriented meal planning app. The heavy borders and hard shadows created a jarring experience that didn't align with the warm, welcoming brand personality.

- **Typography:** Manrope (sans-serif), Caveat (script), Cormorant Garamond (serif)

## Design Philosophy Evolution

| Version | Philosophy | Visual Language | Target Feeling |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1.0 | Editorial, Personal | Soft pastels, script fonts | Intimate, handwritten |
| 1.5 (Rejected) | Neo-Brutalist | Hard shadows, bold borders | Playful, retro |
| 2.0 (Current) | Warm & Cozy | Subtle shadows, lime accents | Professional, inviting |

## Lessons Learned

### From 1.0 → 2.0
- Modern SaaS applications benefit from professional, clean design systems
- Plus Jakarta Sans provides better readability than script-heavy designs
- Subtle borders and shadows work better for complex UIs

### From 1.5 Rejection

- Family-oriented apps need warmth, not aggression
- Heavy borders reduce usability in dense interfaces (meal planners, shopping lists)
