# Research Objective: Meal Planning App Monetization Strategies for Solopreneurs

## Core Research Questions

1. **Revenue Models**: What monetization strategies have proven successful for meal planning apps, specifically those built and operated by solo founders?
2. **Pricing Psychology**: What price points and pricing structures (freemium, subscription tiers, one-time purchase, usage-based) work best for this market?
3. **Market Validation**: What's the realistic revenue potential for a solopreneur-operated meal planning app?
4. **Competitive Differentiation**: How can a solo-built app compete against well-funded competitors?
5. **Growth Levers**: What acquisition and retention strategies work without a marketing budget?
6. **Technical Moats**: What features create defensibility for a small player?
7. **Failure Patterns**: Why do most meal planning apps fail to monetize effectively?
8. **Adjacent Revenue**: What complementary revenue streams (affiliate, partnerships, content) are viable?

## Success Criteria

- Identify 5+ viable monetization models with evidence of success
- Document at least 10 case studies (successes AND failures)
- Uncover non-obvious revenue opportunities specific to solopreneurs
- Provide actionable pricing recommendations with market validation
- Map the competitive landscape with realistic positioning options
- Surface contrarian insights that challenge conventional wisdom

## Evidence Standards

1. **Primary Sources** (highest weight): Founder interviews, revenue reports, App Store/Play Store data, SEC filings
2. **Secondary Sources**: Industry reports, analyst coverage, journalistic investigations
3. **Tertiary Sources**: Blog posts, podcasts, social media claims (require triangulation)
4. **Speculative**: Expert predictions, trend analysis (label clearly)

## Key Stakeholders & Perspectives

- **Solopreneur founders**: Resource constraints, time limitations, technical capabilities
- **End users**: Price sensitivity, willingness to pay, feature expectations
- **Competitors**: VC-backed apps, established players, other indie developers
- **Platform gatekeepers**: Apple/Google take rates, web payment alternatives
- **Adjacent markets**: Recipe sites, grocery delivery, fitness apps, diet programs

## Potential Biases to Guard Against

- **Survivorship bias**: Only studying successful apps while ignoring failures
- **Tech bubble bias**: Overvaluing VC-backed growth metrics over sustainable revenue
- **Recency bias**: Assuming current trends (AI, subscription fatigue) will persist
- **Solo founder romanticism**: Underestimating the advantages of funded competitors
- **Feature creep assumption**: Believing more features = more revenue

## Research Scope

- **Geographic focus**: Primary US/EU markets, secondary: global English-speaking
- **Time horizon**: Historical (2015-present), current state, future (2025-2030)
- **App types**: Mobile apps, web apps, PWAs, hybrid solutions
- **Revenue range of interest**: $1K-$100K MRR (solopreneur-realistic)
