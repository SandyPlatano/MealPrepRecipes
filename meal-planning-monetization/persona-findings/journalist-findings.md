   - Interview potential users
   - Validate willingness to pay

3. **MVP scope definition**
   - Core loop: Dietary input → Meal plan → Grocery list
   - AI optional (28% CAGR but adds complexity)
   - Start manual (concierge MVP), automate later

### Phase 2: Launch (Months 3-6)

1. **Pricing strategy**

## Conclusion: State of the Market

The meal planning app market in 2024-2025 presents **strong opportunities for solopreneurs** willing to:

1. **Focus on specific niches** rather than competing with established players on breadth
2. **Leverage AI** (28% CAGR) but start simple (10% CAGR still solid)
3. **Build community** for lower CAC and higher retention
4. **Price confidently** ($9-13/month supports solo income faster)
5. **Iterate rapidly** (Marc Lou model: speed > perfection)

**Key Market Validations:**
- $2-5B market size growing 10-13% annually
- Proven freemium conversion rates (3-7%)
- Clear pricing benchmarks across tiers
- Multiple successful indie examples ($1M+ ARR achievable)
- Recent funding activity ($13.5M ModifyHealth) indicates investor confidence

**Cautions:**
- High competition in general meal planning
- Subscription fatigue real concern
- Recipe content creation resource-intensive
- User retention requires ongoing engagement

**Bottom Line for Solopreneurs:**
Breaking even at ~223 subscribers ($9/month) with typical costs. Path to $100K ARR (1,000 subs) realistic in 12-24 months with focused niche, consistent marketing, and product-market fit. Multiple examples (Marc Lou, others) demonstrate $1M+ ARR possible for solo builders with audience + iteration.

The market is mature enough to validate business models but fragmented enough to allow niche domination. Success requires differentiation through niche focus, community building, and authentic founder presence rather than competing on feature breadth.
