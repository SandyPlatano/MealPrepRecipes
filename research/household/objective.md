# Research Objective: Household Collaboration & Multi-User UX Patterns

## Core Research Questions

1. **Architecture**: What are the proven patterns for multi-user household collaboration in consumer apps?
2. **Permissions**: How do successful apps handle household roles, permissions, and shared vs. personal spaces?
3. **Conflict Resolution**: What UX patterns resolve conflicts when multiple users edit shared resources simultaneously?
4. **Onboarding**: How do apps invite household members and handle the "cold start" problem?
5. **Privacy Boundaries**: Where do users expect personal space within shared household contexts?
6. **Sync & Real-time**: What technical approaches work best for real-time household collaboration?
7. **Engagement**: How do apps maintain engagement across all household members, not just the primary user?
8. **Monetization**: What pricing models work for household/family plans?

## Success Criteria

- Identify 15+ apps with household collaboration features worth analyzing
- Document at least 5 distinct permission/role models
- Capture 10+ conflict resolution patterns
- Find evidence of what fails (not just successes)
- Uncover cross-domain patterns from gaming, finance, smart home, and productivity apps
- Generate actionable recommendations for a meal planning app context

## Evidence Standards

- **Primary Sources**: App screenshots, official documentation, patent filings
- **Secondary Sources**: UX case studies, design system documentation, conference talks
- **Tertiary Sources**: Blog posts, reviews, user complaints (for pain points)
- Confidence ratings: High (multiple primary sources), Medium (secondary + user reports), Low (single source/speculation)

## Key Stakeholders & Perspectives

- **Primary User**: The person who sets up the household (usually handles most planning)
- **Secondary Users**: Household members who participate but don't manage
- **Children/Dependents**: Users with restricted permissions
- **Extended Family/Guests**: Temporary or limited access participants
- **Couples without hierarchy**: Equal partnership models

## Potential Biases to Guard Against

- Assuming nuclear family as default (consider roommates, multi-generational, non-traditional)
- Western-centric household structures
- Tech-savvy user bias (consider low-tech household members)
- Assuming one "admin" model fits all
- Over-indexing on successful apps (failures teach more)

## Application Context

This research supports the Meal Prep OS application - a meal planning and recipe management system that needs household collaboration features including:
- Shared meal calendars
- Collaborative grocery lists
- Recipe collections with personal vs. shared spaces
- Dietary preferences per household member
- Task delegation for meal prep

## Research Timeframe

- Historical context: 2010-present (smartphone era household apps)
- Current state: 2023-2025 patterns
- Future trends: 2025-2030 predictions
