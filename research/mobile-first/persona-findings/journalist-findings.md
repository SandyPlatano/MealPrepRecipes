## Expert Opinions (2024-2025)

### On Cook Mode
> "People have to touch their screen with greasy hands while cooking just for the next step. The most significant problem users face is reaching their phone for the next step." — UX Researcher

### On Information Overload
> "Users are not interested in a beautiful collection of recipes, they feel frustrated with too overloaded cooking apps and need clear guidance where to start." — Tubik Studio

### On Recipe UX
> "An apple pie recipe waxes on about every interaction the writer has ever had with an apple in their life. The page floods with ads to the point of illegibility. The measurements are guestimates, and the directions leave room for misunderstanding." — Autumn Kotsiuba, Medium

### On AI Future
> "Personalization is the cornerstone of next-generation recipe apps—modern AI doesn't just generate recipes but creates a holistic culinary ecosystem tailored to individual needs." — Industry Analysis
