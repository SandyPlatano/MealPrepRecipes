## Interaction Paradigm Shifts

### Voice Control Evolution

**Current (2024):**
- Keyword commands ("Hey Yummly, next step")
- Limited vocabulary
- Requires quiet environment
- Error-prone in real kitchen conditions

**Future (2027+):**
- Conversational AI (natural language throughout cooking)
- Noise-robust recognition
- Context-aware responses
- Multi-turn dialogue support

**Prediction:** Voice becomes viable for 30-50% of cooking interactions by 2027, but never replaces visual UI entirely.

### Gesture Control Emerging

**Current Research:**
- Hand gesture recognition via camera/AR
- Air tap, swipe, grab gestures
- Works without touching device

**Kitchen Applications:**
- Wave to advance recipe step
- Pinch to zoom on technique
- Gesture to start/stop timer

**Prediction:** Gesture control becomes standard feature by 2028, especially on tablets and smart displays.

### AR/VR Cooking

**Current State:**
- Research prototypes only
- Requires specialized hardware
- Limited to tech enthusiasts

**2027+ Potential:**
- Smart glasses (Apple Vision Pro descendants)
- Ingredient measurement overlay
- Technique visualization (knife cuts, stir patterns)
- Timer overlays in physical space
