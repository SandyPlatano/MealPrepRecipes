5. What accessibility patterns are essential for cooking apps?

### Shopping Integration UX
1. How do leading apps integrate recipe ingredients with shopping lists?
2. What grocery store integration patterns exist (Instacart, store apps, etc.)?
3. How is pantry tracking implemented to avoid redundant purchases?
4. What UX patterns help with substitutions and alternatives?
5. How do apps handle unit conversion and quantity scaling?

### Mobile-First Patterns
1. What gesture patterns work best for recipe navigation?
2. How do apps handle offline functionality?
3. What onboarding patterns drive retention?
4. How is social sharing and household collaboration implemented?
5. What notification strategies drive engagement without annoyance?

### Integration & Ecosystem
1. How do apps integrate with smart kitchen devices?
2. What health/nutrition tracking integrations exist?
3. How is meal planning calendar UX typically structured?
4. What budget tracking features exist in shopping apps?

## Success Criteria
- Identify 20+ specific UX patterns with evidence of effectiveness
- Document 10+ anti-patterns and documented failures
- Discover 5+ emerging/innovative approaches not yet mainstream
- Map the competitive landscape of cooking/shopping app UX
- Generate actionable recommendations for product development

## Evidence Standards
- **Primary**: Direct app teardowns, official design documentation, user research studies
- **Secondary**: Industry reports, expert reviews, design case studies
- **Tertiary**: Blog posts, Twitter threads, conference talks
- **Speculative**: Patents, concept designs, academic research

## Key Stakeholders & Perspectives
- **Home cooks**: Daily users cooking meals at home
- **Meal preppers**: Batch cooking, weekly planning focus
- **Busy parents**: Time-constrained, family meal coordination
- **Health-conscious users**: Nutrition tracking, dietary restrictions
- **Budget shoppers**: Price comparison, deal hunting
- **Tech-forward users**: Smart home integration, voice assistants

## Potential Biases to Guard Against
- Survivorship bias: Only studying successful apps, missing lessons from failures
- Recency bias: Overweighting current trends vs. proven patterns
- Platform bias: iOS vs Android UX conventions differ
- Geographic bias: US-centric apps vs. global cooking patterns
- Demographic bias: Young tech-savvy users vs. older generations

## Research Scope Boundaries
- **In scope**: Mobile apps, responsive web, PWAs for cooking and grocery
- **In scope**: UX patterns, interaction design, information architecture
- **In scope**: Integration patterns (voice, smart devices, stores)
- **Out of scope**: Backend architecture, pure marketing strategies
- **Out of scope**: Restaurant/food delivery apps (unless relevant patterns)
- **Time range**: Historical context (10+ years) through future predictions (2030+)

## Output Format
Strategic research report with:
- Executive synthesis of key discoveries
- Multi-perspective analysis organized by research persona
