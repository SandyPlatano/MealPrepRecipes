# The Negative Space Explorer: Gaps & Barriers in Cooking/Shopping Apps

**Research Date:** 2025-12-17
**Focus:** What's NOT being discussed, underserved users, missing features, adoption barriers

---

## Executive Summary

While the cooking app market appears saturated, significant gaps exist in serving diverse user populations and addressing real-world barriers to adoption. The industry's focus on tech-forward, affluent users leaves large populations underserved and creates opportunities for differentiation through inclusion.

**Key Discovery:** The largest underserved segments aren't edge cases—they include seniors, low-income users, non-native English speakers, and people with disabilities. Serving these populations well would dramatically expand the addressable market.

## Underserved User Segments

### Segment 1: Seniors and Elderly Users (65+)

**Population Size:** 54 million in US (16%); fastest growing demographic

**Current App Failures:**
- Text too small (even with accessibility settings)
- Touch targets too small for arthritis or tremors
- Complex navigation confuses users
- Assumed smartphone fluency
- Fast-changing interfaces disorienting

**What They Need:**
- Extra-large default text (20pt+)
- Huge touch targets (70pt+)
- Simplified navigation (fewer options, clearer labels)
- Consistent UI (don't redesign frequently)
- Family member connection features
- Print-to-paper option

**Opportunity:**
> "My mother-in-law would use this if she could read the screen"

**Confidence:** HIGH—demographic data, accessibility research support this gap.

---

### Segment 2: Low-Income and Budget-Constrained Users

**Population Size:** 37 million food insecure Americans; millions more budget-conscious

**Current App Failures:**
- Premium features behind paywall
- Assume ingredient availability
- No budget tracking or optimization
- Grocery delivery assumes disposable income

**What They Need:**
- Completely free core experience
- Budget-first meal planning ("feed family of 4 for $50/week")
- SNAP/EBT payment integration
- Store sale/coupon optimization
- Recipes using minimal equipment
- Pantry staple focus

**Opportunity:**
> "Most meal planning apps assume I can just buy whatever"

**Confidence:** HIGH—food insecurity data, user research support this gap.

---
