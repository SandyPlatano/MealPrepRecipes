# Archive: Legacy Design Systems

This directory contains design system documentation that was explored but ultimately rejected in favor of the current **Warm & Cozy** design system.

## Files

### `DESIGN_SYSTEM-retro.md`
- **Status:** Rejected
- **Original Name:** `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- **Design:** Neo-brutalist / Retro UI Kit
- **Reason:** Hard drop shadows, 2px black borders, and Space Mono typography were too harsh for a family meal planning app
- **Replaced by:** Warm & Cozy design system with soft shadows, subtle borders, and Plus Jakarta Sans typography
